# RSAChiper

This simple application was developed as the final project for the _Combinatorics and Cryptography_ course (M.Eng. Computer and Systems Engineering) of the University of L'Aquila (Italy).

Basically, it is an intentionally weak implementation of the RSA Chipher that allows the execution of a very mathematically simple attack ([Weiner's Attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiener%27s_attack)).
